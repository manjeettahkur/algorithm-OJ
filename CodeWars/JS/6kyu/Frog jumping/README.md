## Instructions
You have an array of integers and have a frog that starts at the first position.

Every integer tells you the length of step that you have to make. The length is measured in number of indices.

Your objective is to find how many steps the frog needs to make to go out of array.

The function should return count of steps or -1 in any other case such as: the frog can't move out of the array.

```
data = [1, 2, 1, 5]; // 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> out  steps = 3 
data = [1, -1] // 1 -> -1 -> 1 -> -1 -> .... steps = -1
```
